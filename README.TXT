PROJECT TITLE: CitrusRPG

CitrusRPG is a dungeon-based RPG game coded by Adrian Tran, Ruifeng Zhang,
and Braeton Buckley for UCR's annual hackathon, CitrusHack, in 2015.
The Hackathon's duration was 36 hours.

The project was coded in Greenfoot, an IDE that primarily uses Java.
We were not given any base code, nor any assets. Everything in this
repository was created by us. However, we did receive some code logic
influence from other flash games (specifically for the jump mechanic).

We were too ambitious in this project, as it was our first Hackathon.
We managed to complete around 75% of what we wanted, including proper
movement and jump mechanics, terrain that's interactable, enemy
fight patterns, and a proper health UI.

One thing that we struggled with in particular was the implementation
of different weapons. Although we were on the right track, we ultimately
were not able to finish properly implementing different weapons due
to time constraints.

The Hackathon and completion of this project took place on November 2015.

EDIT: Unfortunately, we neglected to take pictures during the completion of the project, and many of our function calls are now deprecated. However, I am trying to update the code so that I can post a picture or two on this README.
